**Steel Power Load Simulation System** is a multi-layer hybrid simulation platform designed to simulate and analyze power load characteristics during the steel production process.

This project innovatively adopts a three-layer architecture consisting of **LLM (Large Language Model) + AnyLogic (Discrete Event Simulation) + MATLAB FMU (Physical Mechanism Model)**. It achieves end-to-end generation from vague operational descriptions to precise power load waveforms.

## 📖 Introduction

The steel industry is a major consumer of electricity, characterized by loads with strong impacts, large fluctuations, and non-linearity. This system aims to assist:

🏭 **Factories**: Optimize production schedules, reduce demand charges, and perform virtual commissioning.

⚡ **Power Grids**: Analyze power quality and evaluate microgrid stability.

🔬 **Research**: Provide high-quality synthetic data for load prediction algorithms.

### Core Advantages
1.  **Intelligent Configuration**: Utilizes an LLM with a built-in metallurgical expert knowledge base to automatically convert natural language descriptions into professional simulation parameters.
2.  **Fusion of Mechanism & Process**: AnyLogic handles macro-logistics and process constraints, while MATLAB FMU handles micro-electrical physical responses.
3.  **High Fidelity**: Encapsulates physical models based on the FMU (Functional Mock-up Unit) standard to ensure the physical authenticity of energy consumption calculations.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

This system uses Python as the data flow layer, connecting the LLM, AnyLogic, and MATLAB FMU modules to form a closed-loop data stream.

### Three-Layer Architecture Details
1.  **LLM Parameter Configuration Layer**:
    **   Contains built-in metallurgical expert knowledge base Prompts.
    **   Parses user requirements (e.g., "Produce a heat of high-strength steel using 100t of sheared scrap..."), generating two standard JSON configuration files: `control_params.json` (Control Profile) and `config_params.json` (System Configuration Profile).
2.  **AnyLogic Process Simulation Layer**:
    **   Acts as the main simulation engine, reading JSON files to set constraints.
    **   Simulates discrete events such as crane scheduling, ladle turnover, and process waiting times.
    **   Responsible for triggering the start and end of each process.
3.  **MATLAB/Simulink Physical Mechanism Layer**:
    **   Individual energy-consuming devices (EAF, LF, CC) are encapsulated as FMU modules.
    **   Called by AnyLogic to input state variables and output real-time power, voltage, and current.


## ✨ Key Features

**LLM-Driven Parameter Generation**:
*   Automatically generates reasonable parameters such as smelting duration, transformer tap positions, and carbon/oxygen injection rates.
*   Supports scenario switching like "different furnace types," "scrap varieties," and "full-load modes."
    
**FMU Modular Co-simulation**:
*   Supports the FMI 2.0 standard, integrating electrical models compiled by MATLAB/Simulink.
    
**Full-Process Coverage**:
*   Covers the entire process: Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) -> Ladle Furnace (LF) -> Continuous Casting (CC) -> Rolling Mill.
    
**Data Standardization**:
*   Python scripts automatically clean raw output data to generate standard CSV data files ranging from second-level to hour-level resolution based on production schedules.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.8+
*   AnyLogic Professional / University
*   MATLAB/Simulink R2020b or higher

### Step 1: Generate Configuration
Run the Python script to generate the necessary JSON parameter files for simulation using the LLM.

```bash
python main.py --mode config --steel_grade "SWRH82B" --scenario "high_throughput"
```
*Output: Generates `control_params.json` and `config_params.json` in the `LLM_config/output_json/` directory.*

### Step 2: Run Simulation
Start AnyLogic (bridged via Python) and load the JSON files generated in the previous step for inference.

```bash
python main.py --mode simulation --config_dir ./LLM_config/output_json/
```

### Step 3: Analyze Results

```bash
python main.py --mode analyze --input ./results/simulation_output.csv
```
